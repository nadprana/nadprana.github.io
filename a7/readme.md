### What is your generative space? (ie, what kinds of things can this generate?)
My model generates simple emoji-like faces that have eyes, eyebrows, and a mouth.

### What do each of the sliders do?
- WIDTH: control width of face
- HEIGHT: control height of face
- HUE: control hue of face'
- EYEDISTANCE: control distance between eyes
- MOUTHCURVE: control the way the mouth curves, i.e. does it curve upwards, downwards, or not at all
- EYEBROWTILT: control the way eyebrows are slanted, i.e. do they slant upwards, downwards, or not at all

### One related thought from the reading: 
I think the idea of generating art along an N-dimensional cube, as Professor Kate covered in her 'let it grow' talk, is really interesting. The generative space is essentially infinite, and yet, by giving people constrained sliders to play with, it makes them much more confident to explore the space and find something aesthetically pleasing. (This brings me back to the concept of a 'casual creator'.)
