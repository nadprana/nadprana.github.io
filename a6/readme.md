### Layers:
There is only one significant layer in each simulation; it contains the organisms making up the ecosystem.

### Update rules:
Each cell updates based on the object it currently contains, i.e:
If there is nothing in the cell AND it is next to a plant, there is some chance of generating a new plant.
If there is a plant in the cell AND it is next to an animal, there is some chance of spawning a new animal.
If there is an animal in the cell AND it is not next to any food AKA plants, there is some chance of it dying.
 
### Argument: 
One small change can drastically affect the balance of an ecosystem via natural selection.

### Does the simulation currently support your argument?
Yes! It exhibits how the introduction of a new animal into the ecosystem that is slightly better adapted to its environment
can completely topple the populations of other species.
  
### One related thought from the reading:
Parable of the Polygons proves that 'small individual bias' leads to 'large collective bias'.
i.e. one species being able to reproduce slightly faster than the others can quickly make them the dominant species.
