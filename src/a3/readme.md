## NADIRA PRANATIO

### Inspirations:
- I wanted my tools to have a futuristic, bright neon-like look!
- I played around with lots of different blend modes to achieve high contrast colors

### Tool 1 - Lollipop:
- Lets you create mesh-like structures (color0) that are connected by little baubles (color1)
- Draw slowly; see what happens if you create some waves :))

### Tool 2 - Sparkle:
- This tool is so fun and basically just vomits bright glitter all over your screen (based off color1)
- Try playing around with diff sizes!!

### Tool 3 - Glitch:
- Draws lots of curves and looks super trippy (colors are a mix of color0 and color1)

### One related thought from the reading:
I chose to limit the possibility space by giving them a starting artifact, i.e. a dark screen instead of white.
This really accentuates the blend modes I used for my tools and will let them create cooler looking things
much faster than if they had first used a white background!
