## Nadira Pranatio

### Inspirations:
Neon/LED light shows, light sabers, glow masks.

### What do each of the sliders do?
- ZOOM: how zoomed in the canvas is
- RIBBONOPACITY: the opacity of the ribbon
- RIBBONHUE: the color of the ribbon
- RIBBONWIDTH: the thickness of the ribbon's stroke
- FINGERTAPER: the extent to which the fingers taper

### One related thought from the reading:
I really enjoyed Professor Kate's 'Of Muppets, Metaballs and Ballroom Dance' talk. 
In order to create a more cohesive costume, I chose to draw a 'plainer' face in order to emphasize the 'flashier' hands and their secondary motion (i.e. the ribbon).

Thank you to Professor Kate as always for the amazing starter code.
