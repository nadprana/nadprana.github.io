### Inspirations: 

### Particle system 1: Bubbles
- floaty bubble-like particles, used the 'basic particles' starter code
- gets its forces from 'weight' aka gravity, border force, and wiggle
- bubbleWeight controls force of gravity on bubbles, bubbleSpeed controls how fast bubbles move
- debug visualization: velocity (black) and force (blue)

### Particle system 2: FishSchool
- group of fish that travel as a school, used the 'boids-particles' starter code
- gets its forces from alignment, cohesion, thrust, wiggle, and border force
- fishStickiness controls cohesion of fish, fishAlignment controls alignment of fish
- debug visualization: school's average velocity (green), individual velocity (green), individual alignment (purple)

### Particle system 3: TinyShrimp
- cluster of shrimp held together by spring forces, used the 'spring-particles' starter code
- gets its forces from edges/springs, wiggle, drag
- shrimpRepulsion controls strength of springs, shrimpStiffness controls stiffness of springs
- debug visualization: edges between each shrimp (green); thickness increases in proportion to strength of springs


### One related thought from the reading:
When a particle just has one force acting on it, it acts quite predictably. However, when you add another force, like friction or thrust, it's really hard to predict what it will look like without letting it run. It's really cool to see how all these different forces can interact to simulate such life-like systems.
